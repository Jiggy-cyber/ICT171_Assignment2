  <h1>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Awareness Blog</h1>

<h2>What is cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, cybersecurity is he practise that allows us to combat and prevent cyber attacks
and cyber threats providing us with a safer online enviroment.</p>
  <p>This blog is dedicated to helping individuals stay safe online by providing the users knowledge
on cybersecurity practises. Here are some essential tips to protect yourself from cyber threats:</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>1. Use Strong Passwords</h3>
    <p>Using a strong password prevents attackers from easily gusessing your password and gain access to
 perform malicious activities.Always use complex passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid using personal information like birthdays (norton, 2024).</p>
  </div>
<div class="tip">
<h3>2.Avoid visiting suspicious websites:</h3>
<p> Some unsecure websites carry a lot of malware and other viruses that could harm your device.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>3. Update Software Regularly</h3>
    <p>Having your software up to date allows your device to keep with new device trends including
 improved device security which ensure that youâ€™re protected from the latest security vulnerabilities (norton, 2024).</>  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>4. Avoid Suspicious Links</h3>
    <p>Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or untrusted sources (norton, 2024).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
    <p>This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring a code is sent to your phone or email (Australian Cyber Securit>  </div>
<div class="tip">
<h3>6.Perform regular security checks:</h3>
<p> Regular security checks ensures that there are no cyberthreats present and detects present cyberthreats.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In conclusion, I would say that cybersecurity should be implemented in everyone's lives because with the world
now revolving itself around IT, more and more cyberthreats are bound to show up as well. With that being the case,
cybrsecurity is everyone's responsility and by following the simple practises like using strong paswords, avoiding
suspicious websites and links, performing regular software updates/security checks and enabling two-factor
authentication, it will provide a safer online enviroment.
