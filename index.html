  <h1>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Awareness Blog</h1>
<p><b>Name:</b> Jigme Kuendrol Wangchuk</p>
<p><b>Student Number:</b> 35479911</p>
<h2>What is cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, cybersecurity is the practice that allows us to combat and prevent cyberattacks
and cyber threats providing us with a safer online environment.</p>
  <p>This blog is dedicated to helping individuals stay safe online by providing the user with knowledge
on cybersecurity practices. Here are some essential tips to protect yourself from cyber threats:</p>

<img src="https://www.cm-alliance.com/hubfs/60776739_l%20(1).jpg#keepProtocol" />
  <div class="tip">
    <h3>1. Use Strong Passwords</h3>
    <p>Using a strong password prevents attackers from easily guessing your password and gaining access to
 perform malicious activities. Always use complex passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid using personal information like birthdays (norton, 2024).</p>
  </div>
<div class="tip">
<h3>2.Avoid visiting suspicious websites:</h3>
<p> Some unsecure websites carry a lot of malware and other viruses that could harm your device.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>3. Update Software Regularly</h3>
    <p>Having your software up to date allows your device to keep up with new device trends, including
 Improved device security ensures that youâ€™re protected from the latest security vulnerabilities (Norton, 2024).</>  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>4. Avoid Suspicious Links</h3>
    <p>Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or untrusted sources (norton, 2024).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
    <p>This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring a code is sent to your phone or email (Australian Cyber Security>  </div>
<div class="tip">
<h3>6.Perform regular security checks:</h3>
<p> Regular security checks ensure that there are no cyberthreats present and detect present cyberthreats.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In conclusion, I would say that cybersecurity should be implemented in everyone's lives because with the world
Now revolving itself around IT, more and more cyber threats are bound to show up as well. With that being the case,
Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility, and by following the simple practices like using strong passwords, avoiding
suspicious websites and links, performing regular software updates/security checks, and enabling two-factor
Authentication will provide a safer online environment.
